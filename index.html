            <p style="width: ">
              Green energy is any energy type that is generated from natural resources,</br>
               such as sunlight, wind or water.</br>
               It often comes from renewable energy</br>
                sources although there are some </br>
                differences between renewable </br>
                and green energy, which we will</br>
                 explore, below.

            <h1>What does it mean?</h1>
            <p style="width: ">
              In order to be deemed green energy, a resource cannot produce pollution, </br>
              such as is found with fossil fuels. This means that not all sources used by the</br>
               renewable energy industry are green. For example, power generation that burns organic </br>
               material from sustainable forests may be renewable, but it is not necessarily green,</br>
               due to the CO2 produced by the burning process itself. </br>
              Green energy sources are usually naturally replenished, </br>
              as opposed to fossil fuel sources like natural gas or coal,</br> 
              which can take millions of years to develop. </br>
              Green sources also often avoid mining or drilling </br>
              operations that can be damaging to eco-systems.

          <h1>How does it work?</h1>
          <p style="width: ">
            As a source of energy, green energy often comes from renewable energy technologies such</br>
             as solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, biomass and hydroelectric power. </br>
             Each of these technologies works in different ways, </br>
             whether that is by taking power from the sun, </br>
             as with solar panels, or using wind turbines or </br>
             the flow of water to generate energy.</br>
